## **Week #2**
 - Filler

## **Week #1**
-  Did research on how to decouple an ASP.NET MVC project into two separate projects. One for frontend, one for backend (1 hour)
-  Created repo for front-end, and worked with Lucas to decouple the frontend code into it's own project (2 hours)
-  Began creating mock REST API endpoints using AWS API Gateway in order to separate the frontend/backend workflows (3 hours)
-  Spent time refamiliarizing myself with the code I wrote last semester, to refresh my memory (1 hour)
